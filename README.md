# Customized WhatsApp Chat Suggestion

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an AI/ML-powered system that provides personalized chat word suggestions based on individual user preferences and chat history. The goal is to enhance the chat experience by offering context-aware and user-specific word or phrase recommendations.

---

## Features
- **Personalized Suggestions**: Tailored word or phrase recommendations based on the user's past chats.
- **Context-Aware**: Understands the ongoing conversation's context to provide relevant suggestions.
- **Adaptable AI**: Continuously learns from user inputs and adapts to changing preferences.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Ensures user data security and privacy by processing data locally or implementing secure encryption methods.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn
- **Natural Language Processing Tools**: NLTK, SpaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers
- **Database**: SQLite, Firebase, or PostgreSQL (for storing user preferences and chat history)
- **Frontend**: Flask, React, or any lightweight UI framework for integration testing

## Installation
### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or later
2. pip (Python package manager)
3. Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/custom-whatsapp-chat.git
   cd custom-whatsapp-chat
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the environment variables (e.g., for database connections or API keys):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the `.env` file with your specific configurations.

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser or integrated chat platform.
2. Start a chat, and observe personalized suggestions displayed as you type.
3. Adjust settings (if available) to refine suggestions based on your preferences.

---

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collects anonymized chat data from the user (with consent).
   - Stores data securely for AI training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Uses NLP techniques to analyze user-specific patterns, tone, and frequently used phrases.
   - Builds a lightweight model for real-time inference.

3. **Real-Time Suggestions**:
   - Processes ongoing conversation text.
   - Provides context-aware suggestions based on the trained model.

---

## Key Modules
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes chat data.
- **Model Training**: Trains or fine-tunes NLP models for personalized suggestions.
- **Suggestion Engine**: Generates context-aware suggestions in real time.
- **Frontend Integration**: Displays suggestions seamlessly in the chat interface.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple languages.
- Implement emotion detection for empathetic responses.
- Use federated learning for enhanced privacy.
- Integrate with popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram.
